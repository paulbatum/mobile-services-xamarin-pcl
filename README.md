Mobile Services + Xamarin + PCL
===========================

#### Note: This tutorial is somewhat out of date. The easiest way to get started with doing mobile development on Azure is with the Mobile Apps features of Azure App Service. There is a [Xamarin.Forms tutorial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-xamarin-forms-get-started/) that has the correct PCL structure and its much easier than following this tutorial. 

This is a simple tutorial on how to use Mobile Services from a cross platform project using Xamarin, with a focus on using Portable Class Libraries (PCL) to make it easier to share code.

### Prerequisites

- XCode 4.5 and above (to build for iOS)
- [Xamarin tools](http://xamarin.com/download)
- A Windows Azure subscription ([free trial](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial))

### Step 1 - Create the mobile service and download the iOS project

I'll start by creating a new mobile service - lets call it `xamarinpcl`. [This tutorial](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-xamarin-ios/) covers the steps in detail.

I follow the quickstart, clicking the button to create the TodoItem table and then I download the iOS project:

![Downloading quickstart project](/images/create-new-xamarin-app.png)

I'm going to unzip the downloaded project, and rename the folder and project to quickstartpcl-ios to avoid conflicts when I download the project for other platforms. Next I open Xamarin Studio (Visual Studio will work too!), create a new empty solution, add my ios project to it and run:

![Running iOS quickstart](/images/run-ios-quickstart.png)

### Step 2 - Download the Android project

Back on the quickstart page in the Windows Azure portal I'll switch the project type to Android, download, unzip, rename to quickstartpcl-android, add to the solution and run:

![Running android quickstart](/images/run-android-quickstart.png)

### Step 3 - Add the PCL project

In Xamarin Studio I add a new Portable Library project to the solution. I then go to options -> build -> general and select the platforms I want to target. For now I'm going to select .NET 4.5 and remove Silverlight and Windows Phone. I could keep Windows Phone but it makes things a bit more complicated because Windows Phone 8 is missing System.Net.Http so we'll come back to this a bit later.

![Configure PCL targets](/images/configure-pcl-project.png)

Next I'm going to add some references to this project. I want to reference the PCL library that is included in the [Azure Mobile Services component](http://components.xamarin.com/view/azure-mobile-services) that the downloaded projects already reference. I'll also need JSON.NET. I'm going to reference both of these from the `Components/azure-mobile-services-1.1.0/lib/iOS` folder (the versions in the Android folder are exactly the same so that would work too).

![Edit PCL references](/images/add-pcl-references.png)

Now I'm going to update my iOS and Android projects to reference this PCL project and make sure they build OK.

### Step 3 - The Great Refactoring

Now the fun part! Lets pull some shared code into the PCL project. I'll want to take the Mobile Service client, the ToDoItem class, and the code that queries for todo items that are not marked as complete. I could certainly move more over but this should be enough to demonstrate the process. For the sake of simplicity I'll put it all in one file (no I would not do this for a real app):

<pre>
    public class Common
    {
        static Common()
        {
            InitializeClient();
        }

        public static MobileServiceClient MobileService;

        public static void InitializeClient(params DelegatingHandler[] handlers)
        {
            MobileService = new MobileServiceClient(
                @"https://xamarinpcl.azure-mobile.net/",
                @"your app key goes here",
                handlers
            );
        }

        public static IMobileServiceTableQuery<ToDoItem> GetIncompleteItems()
        {
            var toDoTable = MobileService.GetTable&lt;ToDoItem&gt;();
            return toDoTable.Where(item => item.Complete == false);
        }
    }

    public class ToDoItem
    {
        public string Id { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "text")]
        public string Text { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "complete")]
        public bool Complete { get; set; }
    }
</pre>

I then have a bunch of changes to make to the Android and iOS projects to use the shared code. If you want to see the changes, just take a look at [this git commit](https://github.com/paulbatum/mobile-services-xamarin-pcl/commit/d58ec604baee1daaf4178662b9f39e652523d1cf).

Lets build and run both projects to make sure we haven't broken anything:

Awesome!

### Step 4 - Adding Windows Phone 8

Its time to switch gears and flip over to Visual Studio so we can add projects for the Windows platforms. Lets do Windows Phone first. Like before I'll start by downloading the quickstart from the Azure portal and renaming it, but the project file requires a few tweaks before I can add it to the solution. Specifically, I open up the .csproj in a text editor and remove these lines:

	<Import Project="..\packages\Microsoft.Bcl.Build.1.0.8\tools\Microsoft.Bcl.Build.targets" />
  	<Import Project="$(SolutionDir)\.nuget\nuget.targets" />

The first of these lines will get added again when I update or reinstall the Bcl.Build Nuget package. The second line is no longer necessary because Visual Studio now restores NuGet packages naturally.

Now the project can be added to the solution without errors. Next I want to do a bit of cleanup on the NuGet packages used by this project so I open the NuGet package explorer, let it restore packages if required, and then remove the async package and update all the remaining packages. Lets make sure it builds and runs before we make any more changes:

![Add Windows Phone 8 project](/images/add-wp8-proj.png)

The next step is to update the project to use our shared code. Now to be able to reference my shared project, I'll need to update its targets to include WP8. So lets do that now and build:

![Windows Phone 8 http errors](/images/wp8-http-errors.png)

Uhoh! Windows Phone 8 doesn't have HttpClient, and so our PCL is not valid. We can fix this by using the [HttpClient NuGet package](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Net.Http/) which the Windows Phone 8 project is already using. I right click on the solution, select Manage NuGet Packages and make sure that for HttpClient, my shared project is ticked:

![Add http client](/images/add-http-client.png)

This fixes my compilation errors, but there is a catch. The NuGet for HttpClient uses Bcl.Build for some of its magic, but this magic doesn't work quite right with Xamarin yet. To see this in action, run the iOS project on a real device and you'll get the error "This header must be modified with the appropiate property":

![assembly binding redirect hell](/images/assembly-binding-redirect-hell.png)

The BCL team at Microsoft is aware of this issue but at the current time of writing this issue hasn't been fixed, so here's the workaround: in your iOS and Android projects, replace the generated app.config with the following:

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<configuration>
	  	<runtime>
		    <assemblyBinding xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
		      <dependentAssembly>
		        <assemblyIdentity name="System.Net.Http" publicKeyToken="b03f5f7f11d50a3a" culture="neutral" />
		        <bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-4.0.0.0" newVersion="2.5.0.0" />
		      </dependentAssembly>
		    </assemblyBinding>
	  	</runtime>
	</configuration>

This forces the Mono version of HttpClient into use. Be aware that as you work with your projects, you may find that certain actions cause your app.config to be regenerated and it may become invalid again. They key to remember is that for Http related assemblies, your iOS and Android projects need the binding above.

You might also see warnings in Visual Studio about incorrect assembly bindings. My advice is to ignore any of such warnings that appear for your iOS and Android projects. 

Now that I have my shared PCL targeting the correct platforms AND the existing projects are working again I can go back to refactor my WP8 project to use the shared code. The changes are pretty simple, you can see them [here](https://github.com/paulbatum/mobile-services-xamarin-pcl/commit/c0ae54b6f4c6e5261f4a126da11a0552bac8159f). Lets run it to see if it still works:

![wp8 done](/images/wp8-works-pcl.png)

Huzzah! That was a bit tougher than the previous steps but we made it. We now have a solution that is sharing Mobile Services code between iOS, Android and WP8.
